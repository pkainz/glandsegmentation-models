# Colon Gland Segmentation Models
This repository contains the trained *ObjectNet* and *SeparatorNet* models from our participation in the [GlaS@MICCAI'2015 Gland Segmentation Challenge Contest](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/tia/glascontest/). 

Please cite our work if you use these models:

The models are stored for use with the [Pylearn2](http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn2/) machine learning library.
